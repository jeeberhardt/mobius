About Mobius
============

Mobius attempts to offer a generalized Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to 
support the design and optimization of peptides in a fully automated closed-loop 
Design-Make-Test (DMT) pipeline context. 

Capable of handling arbitrary peptide scaffolds (such as macrocycles and branched 
structures) and non-natural amino acids using the HELM notation, Mobius offers a
variety of peptide scanning strategies (including alanine, random, homolog, and 
property-based scanning) for generating the initial batch of peptides. It also 
features multiple surrogate models (Gaussian Process and Random Forest), acquisition 
functions, and a range of sequence descriptors.

Flexible and modular, Mobius can be easily extended to accommodate custom surrogate 
models and descriptors, ensuring adaptability to specific needs and requirements.
