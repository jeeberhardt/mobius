Summary
=======
This MHC class II binding affinity dataset consists of 44, 541 experimentally measured binging affinities covering 26 alleric variants.
Two sets of randomly splitted 5-fold cross validation data are provided: the entire dataset ("ALL") and the similarity reduced dataset ("SR").

File format:
------------
Files in both the datasets contain tab separated values in following order -  
species
allele name
binding length
cross-validation partition
peptide sequnence
inequality
ic50 value
